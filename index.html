        <h2>Statistical modeling, complex systems, and applied machine learning.</h2>
        <p>
          I am a research assistant professor in physics working at the interface of
          statistical inference, network modeling, and the health of complex systems. My work
          combines rigorous mathematics, data-driven modeling, and algorithm design to
          understand, predict, and control complex systems in the real world.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics at Clarkson University
        in Potsdam, New York. My background includes a Ph.D. and M.S. in Physics from Clarkson University,
        and a B.A. in Physics from SUNY Plattsburgh, with additional coursework in mathematics, and chemistry.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research centers on statistical modeling, time series analysis, anomaly detection,
        and information-theoretic inference, with applications to networked systems.
        I enjoy building models that not only fit data, but also provide interpretable insight and
        actionable predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond research, I am deeply engaged in teaching and mentoring as well as public outreach.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        My research focuses on the statistical structure and dynamics of complex systems, with an emphasis
        on time series, anomaly detection, and network modeling. I work at the intersection of physics,
        statistics, and machine learning, often using information-theoretic tools to extract structure
        from noisy, high-dimensional data.
